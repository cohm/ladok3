We want to compute statistics based on LADOK data.
We want to answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label[question]{QGradeDistInCourse} What are the grade distribution of a 
course round?
\item\label[question]{QGradeDistDiffYears} How do grade distributions differ 
between years (\ie rounds) for the same course?
\item\label[question]{QGradeDistDiffCourses} How do grade distributions differ 
between (similar) courses?
\item How is the throughput distribution of a course?
\item How do throughput distributions vary between years?
\end{enumerate}

We provide the program [[stats-data.py]] to extract the necessary data from 
LADOK (\cref{StatsData}).
This program will produce CSV-formated data to answer those questions.
The data is formated like this:
\begin{itemize}
\item course,
\item round,
\item component,
\item student (pseudonym),
\item grade,
\item normalized time.
\end{itemize}

Then we provide ways to analyze that data.
We answer
\cref{QGradeDistInCourse,QGradeDistDiffYears,QGradeDistDiffCourses}
in \cref{GradeDistributions}.
